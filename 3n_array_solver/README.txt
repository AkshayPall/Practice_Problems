This is a solution to a problem in which you must find if the sum k
exists in from the addition of one element each from 3 unsorted
integer arrays of size n in Order n^2 time. 

ex. let k = 0 and n = 5

Array 1 {1, -5, 6, 7, 3}
Array 2 {0, 2, 65, 23, 6}
Array 3 {1, 68, -1, 54, 2}

The sum of k DOES exist from the addition of 1, 0, and -1 from the
respective arrays.
